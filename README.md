## Launcher or any additional game files?
  ```sh
  Eventually I want the mod to strictly run through a launcher so I can add updates information and such
  - Only additional code as in the 'new code added and the assets that come with it'
  ```
  ## Mod WIP Features
  ```sh
  I wanted this mod to be different from the rest so here are some things that I will have implented
  
  - 'Player Profiles'
  - 'Global Matching (pvp (1v1) Free For All)'
  - 'GUI enhancements'
  - 'More masterclient server options'
  - 'New Commands (Non / Masterclient)'
  - 'Update message for every push through client'
  ```
  
  ## Mod Feature Pictures
  ```sh
  - Pictures will be out soon of all the mod features!
  - All the information on the features and list and access you have on commands
  - Wiki Very Soon ;)
  ```
  
  ## Special Thanks
  - [Fenglee](http://fenglee.com/), without you, we wouldn't have the [base game](http://fenglee.com/game/aog/) that we all know and love.
  - [RiceCake](https://github.com/rc174945), this mod probably wouldn't even be a thing if [RC](https://aotrc.weebly.com/) didn't exist either.
  - To everyone that helped!
